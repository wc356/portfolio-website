      "Throughout my self-learning journey into coding, I have struggled to find a good pattern and a study method that worked for a long time.\
    \n\nI mean, the first 3 months, I was coding for 5-8 hours daily with very little intermittent breaks in between. I was HUNGRY to learn and found coding very exciting to learn during this initial phase 🙌🏻🙌🏻 Seeing immediate changes in the browser with simple HTML and CSS empowered me, and I felt like I could make anything 🦾🦾\
    \n\n...until I started learning JavaScript 🙃\
    \n\nHaving gone through tutorials, I understood how HTML, CSS and JavaScript individually, but what I had most trouble with was understanding—'How do they connect? How do they work in conjunction with one another? 🤔💭'\
    \n\nAs I began going deeper in my learning, my focus and work rhythm really took a toll. It felt like there was so much to learn at once, and I had trouble focusing on what fundamentals were important to grasp first. As I was learning JavaScript, I wanted to learn Python and React, package managers, git, linux, discover IDE plugins and so much more 🤦🏻‍♂️. And not having a clear goal or outline for myself really side-tracked my learning and lowered the efficacy of my focus on a subject. I needed to implement a system for myself to have an overall macro and micro goals that I could use to stay on track of which subjects and how much time I was going to allot for projects.\
    \n\nEversince implementing a calendar 📅 of internal deadlines, check-off lists, and a daily routine throughout the week, I have been able to get an understanding of what I was learning and how much I accomplished throughout the week. If I was stuck on a topic or a problem, I was able to shift my focus onto some other subject and come back with a new perspective that helped me shed light on the question at hand 💡💡\
    \n\n Another method that has been helping me tremendously is talking to myself while coding 🗣. This forces me to organize my logic at a low-level so that the goals are clearly defined. With the basic logic at hand by talking, I would write out my goals as comments, not worrying about the grammar and syntax while defining my intentions first. After, I would implement those defined goals into code, and by this time, I would have saved a lot of headache, time and stress 😎",
