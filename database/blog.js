      \n\nPersonally, my most current struggle has been‚Äîaccepting sub-optimal solutions. I find that the more fluent I become in coding, the urge to want to optimize my projects overwhelm me. For example, I decided to scrap my sub-optimal, yet, finished code and spent extra 3 days to implement a loop structure over a JSON object. I decided that this loop format would better scale, and would be favorable for maintaining code base for myself.\
