In choosing SSR, I was hard-stuck on hydration issues where the SSR did not match the CSR in the version of NextJS I have been working with (9.3.4). However, I am THOROUGHLY enjoying the sheer convenience in NextJS and Zeit's deployment system with automatic integration of Git repository. Using NextJS allowed me to be hassle-free in deployment and test out the production of my website on different platforms and devices.\", \"In the next phase of the project, I would consider making a CMS, as it would allow for better management and organization of content over time, and allows for better scaling as well.\", \"Bootstrapping would have been a great framework to implement and save time. However, I do think that not relying on such a framework like Bootstrap allowed the project to be light-weight and prevent any bloating.\", \"Through this project, I realized how important it is to plan ahead, and think about how to implement the overall structure—CSS, database, HOC—into an easy to manipulate and scalable network. For example, I would try and use 'em' and 'rem' units for the fonts, padding and margins to support scalability, accessibility, and responsive design. Use of such relative units would allow for modular components, even though they might also bring some complexity to the code.
