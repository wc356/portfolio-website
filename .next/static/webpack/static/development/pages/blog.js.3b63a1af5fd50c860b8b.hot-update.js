  title: "Hacking My Learning Process 🧠⚡️",
  body: "Throughout my self-learning journey into coding, I have struggled to find a good pattern and a study method that worked for a long time.\
    \n\nI mean, the first 3 months, I was coding for 5-8 hours daily with very little intermittent breaks in between. I was HUNGRY to learn and found coding very exciting to learn during this initial phase 🙌🏻🙌🏻 Seeing immediate changes in the browser with simple HTML and CSS empowered me, and I felt like I could make anything 🦾🦾\
    \n\n...until I started learning JavaScript 🙃\
    \n\nHaving gone through tutorials, I understood how HTML, CSS and JavaScript individually, but what I had most trouble with was understanding—'How do they connect? How do they work in conjunction with one another? 🤔💭'\
    \n\nAs I began going deeper in my learning, my focus and work rhythm really took a toll. It felt like there was so much to learn at once, and I had trouble focusing on what fundamentals were important to grasp first. As I was learning JavaScript, I wanted to learn Python and React, package managers, git, linux, discover IDE plugins and so much more 🤦🏻‍♂️. And not having a clear goal or outline for myself really side-tracked my learning and lowered the efficacy of my focus on a subject. I needed to implement a system for myself to have an overall macro and micro goals that I could use to stay on track of which subjects and how much time I was going to allot for projects.\
    \n\nEversince implementing a calendar 📅 of internal deadlines, check-off lists, and a daily routine throughout the week, I have been able to get an understanding of what I was learning and how much I accomplished throughout the week. If I was stuck on a topic or a problem, I was able to shift my focus onto some other subject and come back with a new perspective that helped me shed light on the question at hand 💡💡\
    \n\n Another method that has been helping me tremendously is talking to myself while coding 🗣. This forces me to organize my logic at a low-level so that the goals are clearly defined. With the basic logic at hand by talking, I would write out my goals as comments, not worrying about the grammar and syntax while defining my intentions first. After, I would implement those defined goals into code, and by this time, I would have saved a lot of headache, time and stress 😎",

  body: "For me, quarantine is nothing new. Eversince quiting my full-time job as a Designer and moving out of my apartment in Washington D.C. area, I've fully dedicated myself to CODING, and CODING ONLY 👨🏻‍💻🧙🏻‍♂️.\
    \n\nThat meant stayng back at my parent's place, for however long my career transition would take, and having to deal with living with others again 🙃. And eversince I've been back to my home state of New Jersey, SO MUCH has changed.\
    \n\nOne of those changes is fairly obvious—the coronavirus 🦠😷.\
    \n\nI remember at first, when the news of the virus hit the media, I was less worried and did not think much of the situation—afterall, there were similar cases with ebola, swine flu, zika virus, SARS 🦠—and I assumed this was just another one of those events.\
    \n\nAlso, by the time of the coronavirus breakout, I was around 6 months well into my isolated lifestyle, having very little social interaction with the outside world, other than the occasional gym 💪 and weekend dates 💗. I had been very isolated from the world of events, because I was focused on dedicating my attention and time to adjusting my mindset to programming 🧠🥴.\
    \n\nWhen I realized the virus was getting more serious than I had first previously thought, I decided to completely shelter myself from the outside world and stopped going to the gym and outside on the weekends 😵😵.\
    \n\nBut having gotten used to this—quarantine, isolation lifestyle, I realized that working remotely is definitely a viable option (for me at least). I am able to focus on just coding, not not having to worry about what to eat, remember to get gas on the way to work, or deal with the hassle of public-transportation and being on time 💁🏻‍♂️.",
